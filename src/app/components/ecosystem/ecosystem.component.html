  <h1>Ethereum Development Tools</h1>
  <p>
    Before we start learning how to code in ethereum blockchain, let's get familiarize with the tools that we will be using for
    development. The following are the tools and plugins that we will use in this tutorial.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Geth (or) Go-Ethereum</li>
    <!--<li>Mist and MetaMask Plugin</li>-->
    <li>Remix</li>
    <li>Solidity</li>
    <li>Web3.js</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <b>Geth or Go-Ethereum: </b> Go-Ethereum often refered as Geth is a blockchain node which is running on client side.
    It's an Ethereum CLI and is the entry point to Ethereum network. Geth can run in full node mode (default behaviour),
    archive node (all historical data) or in a light node mode.It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Ethereum
    network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports.
  </p>
  <!--<p>
    <b>Mist and MetaMask: </b> These are used to connect browsers to blockchain. Any application that uses blockchain functionalities
    need to connect to blockchain node. MetaMask is a google chrome plug in to connect to blockchain. Where as Mist is a
    full browser that has its own blockchain node implemented. Mist is integrated with Geth node. MetaMask uses Infura which
    intern has Geth/parity blockchain nodes running.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Remix: </b> Remix is an IDE running on Cloud. You don't have to install it and can simply access it from <a target="_blank" href="http://remix.ethereum.org">Remix.ethereum.org</a>.
    You can use remix to compile solidity code, run and debug it. It has in-memory blockchain, which makes very easy to test
    your solidity programs/contracts.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Solidity: </b> Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. It was influenced
    by C++, Python and JavaScript. A solidity program gets compiled in to byte code using EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) similar to other programming languages, say for example JAVA.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Web3.js: </b> This is the Ethereum compatible JavaScript API which implements the Generic JSON RPC spec. It's also available
    on npm as a node module. Web applications which require blockchain interaction can use this javascript API to communicate
    with blockchain.
